Interpolate something. Without an output file, interpolate in place.
There is the option of generating nearest interpolation sample files
and reusing these index files to save time on sample further files.
I intend to include this sampling in pbs scripts so that they sample
the first time step once, and then perform what I hope is a constant
time construction for later files. See the --gen-samples and --sample
options.

Usage:
  interp.py [options] <input> [<output> [<var>...]]
  interp.py [options] [--gen-samples | -G ] <input> <output>

Options:
  -h --help                   Show this help.
  -v --verbose                Turn on verbosity.
  -x --X                      Use X in interpolation.
  -y --Y                      Use Y in interpolation.
  -z --Z                      Use Z in interpolation.
  --xres=XRES                 Set the resolution along the x direction [default: 100].
  --yres=XRES                 Set the resolution along the y direction [default: 100].
  --zres=XRES                 Set the resolution along the z direction [default: 100].
  --permute -p                Swap the order of axes for 2D data.
  --hdf=GROUP -H GROUP        Read an hdf5 file at the given group. If there
                              is no supplied argument, read at the root.
  --gen-samples -G            Instead of interpolating, generate a sample file
                              and output to <output>.
  --sample=S -s S             Load the sample file S and use these indices to sample
                              the input file to create a interpolated file.
  --zip -z                    Compress for hdf5.

    Returns indices that perform nearest interpolation given a

    Parameters

        shape (n,D), or a tuple of `ndim` arrays.
